# music-note-extraction
 - Use `python3` and `cv2` to implement simple OCR to extract music note from a sheet music.
 - Since the project doesn't use CNN or other neural networks, the result is not good enough for recognizing some images with distortion.

## Usage 
``` python
python MusicNoteExtraction.py path

path: Image path.
```

## Requirements
 - `python3`.
 - `opencv-python`.
